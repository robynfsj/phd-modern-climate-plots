# Modern Climate Plots

This is one of the repositories created as part of my PhD. [modern-climate.R](https://github.com/robynfsj/phd-modern-climate-plots/blob/main/modern-climate.R) creates climate plots of mean monthly temperature and precipitation for my two study sites — Lake Ioannina and Lake Ohrid. 

## Data sources
The data for Lake Ioannina is observed mean monthly data for the period 1956–2010 ((Hellenic National Meteorological Service, 2020). The data for Lake Ohrid was more difficult to obtain. The precipitation data is observed mean monthly precipitation for the period 1971–2000 (World Meteorological Organization, 2020). The temperature data is modelled data based on observed measuresments (Merkel, 2018) as no observed mean temperature data are available.
